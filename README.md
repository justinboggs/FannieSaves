## Project Description/Outline: 
Our website, FANNIESAVES.WIN, features an ML-powered application that allows Fannie Mae to supplement their loan purchasing selection by giving a powerful tool to help determine the quality of an existing loan and its likely future performance. The target audience for the application on the website is a Fannie Mae analyst or mortgage purchase specialist. We utilize SciKit Learn and PyCaret for our ML model set-up, selection and tuning, and make this model available to the analyst / purchase specialist on our website.
